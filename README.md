# Millionaire game
This is a simple simulation of
millionaire game that includes:
* **Spring MVC**
* **Spring Security**
* **Spring Data**
* **Spring Boot**

To test the project right click on class ApplicationSpringBoot >
 Run as .. > Spring Boot App. Then go to
 http://localhost:8080

All the users have virtual accounts,
so you need to register at first.  
You'll not find any users registered as
there's an **H2** in-memory database (you 
don't have to do any configurations).

The templates are made using **thymeleaf**
 and **bootstrap 4**. On the `profile`
 page you'll see statistics of
 your games. You're also free to look at
 general statistics (go on the `statistics` 
 page). To play the game go to `game` page.
There are only 5 questions available.
Again, it's only a _simulation_ for 
studying purposes. 

Have fun :)
